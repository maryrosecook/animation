# Animation

Use gestures to create visually primitive but expressive movies.

```
As an unskilled animator
So I can depict objects
I want to be able to draw outlines

As an unskilled animator
So I can show change
I want to be able to move objects

As an unskilled animator
So I can show movement
I want to be able to replay drawings

As an unskilled animator
So I can depict complex events
I want to be able to have multiple things happen simultaneously
```
