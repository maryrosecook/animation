# Animation

Use gestures to create visually primitive but expressive movies.

```
To do

As a friendly person
So I can share my drawings
I want the app the work on mobile

As an unskilled animator
So I can build up objects quickly
I want to be able to create an object from collections of dots

As an unskilled animator
So I can create more complex events
I want to be able to move individual objects

As an unskilled animator
So I can depict complex events
I want to be able to have multiple things happen simultaneously

Done

As an unskilled animator
So I can show movement
I want to be able to move objects

As an unskilled animator
So I can depict objects
I want to be able to draw outlines

As an unskilled animator
So I can show movement
During replay, I want to play back the creation of the drawing
```
